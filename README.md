# GPT on your data Orchestrator

Part of [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag)

## Components

**1** [Data ingestion](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ingestion)

**3** [App Front-End](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-frontend)

## Deploy (quickstart)

Here are the steps to configure cognitive search and deploy ingestion code using the terminal.

**First check your environment meets the requirements**

- You need **[AZ CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)** to log and run Azure commands in the command line.
- You need **Python 3.10** to run the setup script. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) helps you creating and managing your python environments. 
- **[Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-python#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)** will be needeed to deploy the chunking function.

**1) Login to Azure** 

run ```az login``` to log into azure. Run ```az login -i``` if using a VM with managed identity to run the setup.

**2) Clone the repo** 

If you plan to customize the ingestion logic, create a new repo by clicking on the **Use this template** button on top of this page.

Clone the repostory locally:  ```git clone https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag-orchestrator```

*If you created a new repository please update the repository URL before running the command*

**3) Adjust your prompt** 

In VSCode you can change the prompt text if you want a custom prompt. 
Use the  ```question_answering.prompt``` located in ```orc/prompts/``` folder, just rembember to keep the *Sources: {sources}* text in the bottom.

**4) Deploy function to Azure** 

Enter in the cloned repo folder: 

```cd gpt-rag-orchestrator```

Use Azure Functions Core Tools to deploy the function: 

```func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_APP_NAME --python```

After finishing the deployment run the following command to confirm the function was deployed:  

```func azure functionapp list-functions FUNCTION_APP_NAME```

*Replace FUNCTION_APP_NAME with your Orchestrator Function App name before running the command*

**5) Deploy locally (optional)**

With Azure Function extension installed you just need to open ```orc/orchestrator.py``` and "Start Debugging" in VSCode. <br>It will start the server in ```http://localhost:7071/api/orc```.

Since we're now using managed identities you will have to assign the following roles to your user in order to test orchestrator locally:

1. Azure CosmosDB 'Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor' role.

```
resourceGroupName='your resource group name'
cosmosDbaccountName='CosmosDB Service name'
roleDefinitionId='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002'
principalId='Object id of your user in Microsoft Entra ID'
az cosmosdb sql role assignment create --account-name $cosmosDbaccountName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --scope "/" --principal-id $principalId --role-definition-id $roleDefinitionId
```

2. Azure OpenAI resource 'Cognitive Services OpenAI User' role.

```
subscriptionId='your subscription id'
resourceGroupName='your resource group name'
openAIAccountName='Azure OpenAI service name'
principalId='Object id of your user in Microsoft Entra ID'
az role assignment create --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" --assignee $principalId --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/$openAIAccountName
```
